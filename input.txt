Please set surface width, time step, generation of the simulation as well as canvas width, scaling factor, and sampling frequency of the gif.
The parameters should be input as order above and separated by a space after "$" symbol.
surface-width time-step generation scaling-factor canvas-width frequency
example: $200.0 1 1 1 1000 1
$400.0 0.01 100 1 1000 1

Please declare species (i.e. kinds of molecules) that involved in the Simulation.
Avaliable colors: red,blue,green,yellow,pink,cyan
If a species don't exist at beginning, please put zero at "initial-number"
name  radius  mass  diffusion-rate color initial-number
example: #A 3 1 500 red 100
example: #B 3 1 500 blue 100
#A 3 1 500 red 400
#B 3 1 500 blue 400

Please declare reactions you wish to simulate.
Zeroth order reaction starts with a "z>"; unimolecular starts with a "u>", bimolecular reaction starts with "b>". No space after these prefix.
if a single molecule vanishes after a reaction, just leave product blank
example: u>A A A 2 #This means unimolecular reaction A->2A with a reaction-constant=2
example: b>A B B B 40000 #This means bimolecular reaction A+B->2B with a reaction-constant=40000
u>A A A 2
u>B 2
b>A B B B 40000
